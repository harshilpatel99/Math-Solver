# Math-solver
A c++ code which can solve any type of arithmetic equation, any polynomial with degree 3 and is also able to solve 2 variable equations.

Type of input accepted:
1. ARITHMETIC EQUATIONS 
  - You can write the arithmetic equation in any format
  - But you can only use '(' ')' round brackets, Number of brackets doesn't matters

2. POLYNOMIAL EQUATIONS
  - Degree 3 is only allowed
  - a*x*x*x+b*x*x+c*x+d=e where a,b,c,d,e belongs to any real integers

3. 2-VARIABLE EQUATIONS
  - ax + by = c
  - px + qy = r  where a,b,c,p,q,r belongs to any real numbers
